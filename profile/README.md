# 🍻 Welcome to Beerhunt-Studios

Hey there!  
We're **Beerhunt-Studios** – a small dev team made up of two idiots 🌚 who decided to bring their creative passions together. Right at this moment, we’re working on our very first project: **ChordConnect**.

We're not ready to reveal details, but more on that soon – promise!

## 👋 Who we are

### **Kimon Meier**  
Kimon’s a software developer who's currently training to become a train driver. When he's not learning signals and timetables, he’s deep into code or gaming. He’s the one making sure ChordConnect actually works, or he tries 🌚.

### **Melvin Göldi**  
Melvin’s a producer, songwriter, and musician with a big love for creativity in all forms. Whether it's making music, brainstorming ideas, or gaming, he's always chasing the next cool thing to create.

## 🎶 About ChordConnect

**ChordConnect** is our first baby.  
We’re building it with musicians and creatives in mind. It's a place where artists can connect, grow, and come to life. It's still under active development for now, but we’re super excited to show you more soon.

## 🚧 Stay tuned!

This page will grow with us – we’ll be sharing updates, behind-the-scenes stuff, and all the highs (and probably a few lows) of building something from scratch.

Thanks for stopping by and remember look always in both directions, before crossing the road. ❤️  
– Kimon & Melvin
